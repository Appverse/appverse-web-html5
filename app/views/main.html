<div class="hero-unit">
  <h1>AppVerse Client Framework Incubator</h1>
  <p>Some topics will be included in this framework.</p>

<!--AngularUI Bootstrap directives work on classes, 
so simply by adding a class to tags weâ€™ll have a fully 
functioning style feature. For exmple:
  <ul>
    <li class="dropdown">
      <a class="dropdown-toggle">
        Click here to see topics to be included.
      </a>
      <ul class="dropdown-menu">
        <li ng-repeat="issue in issuesList">{{issue}}</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
-->
  <ul>
      <li ng-repeat="issue in issuesList">{{issue}}</li>
  </ul>
  <p>..we're working on it.</p>
  <h3>Enjoy coding!</h3>
