            <br>
            <br>Select the <b>"Four threads"</b> option and compare the values in <b>"Time for Execution"</b>.

Search for the most appropriate number of threads for each specific process. Then, include the value in the configuration (<b>PERFORMANCE_CONFIG.webworker_pooled_threads</b>).</p>
